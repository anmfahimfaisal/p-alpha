**Task 1:**

Prepare a Name Entity recognition model (using spacy) which can detect food names from text. You don't have to train it from scratch. The model that you will prepare must detect the existing entities and the custom FOOD entities. Task breakdown

- Custom small food dataset preparation and preprocess for spacy NER dataset format
- Train the model
- Proper explanation with documentation
- Prepare all the scripts clearly so that anyone can train with any type of dataset easily, not only food data.

**Task 2:**

Write a paper summary of these three papers. You must cover strong points and the limitations of the papers and a short review of the model architecture and its working process.
